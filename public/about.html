<h1>about mi-ng!</h1>
<hr />
<p>hello,  everybody. i'm ming, a 19-year-old filipino and student of web development. i took this route this year having graduated senior highschool in laguna state polytechnic university and having been set on taking a gap year to prepare myself with skills and possibly some financial gain from such skills for my coming years in college.</p>

<p>i have always had a curiosity for this field. i had never planned in my younger years a career fully-based in it. but now, it is something that stimulates me and certainly brings me joy for the present and for my future. i hope nothing but the best for this venture.</p>

<p>thank u for taking the time to consider this section. take care!</p>
